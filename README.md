Arduino-Simon-Game
==================

This is an Arduino-based game of Simon Says that is meant to run on an ATtiny44 microcontroller. 

Included in this repo:

- Arduino code: the core code of the Simon game

- Fritzing project files: the project files for the PCBs, including a breadboard view and schematic

- Gerber files: if you want to print your own PCBs, then by all means, go for it!
