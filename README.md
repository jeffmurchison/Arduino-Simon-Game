Arduino-Simon-Game
==================

This is an Arduino-based game of Simon Says that is meant to run on an ATtiny44 microcontroller (though it will easily run on any Arduino such as an Uno, Mega, Leonardo, or Duemilanove.



Included in this repo:

- Arduino code: the core code of the Simon game

- Fritzing project files: the project files for the PCBs, including a breadboard view and schematic

- Gerber files: if you want to print your own PCBs, then by all means, go for it!
